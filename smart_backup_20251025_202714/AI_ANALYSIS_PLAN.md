# AI Analysis Features Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for integrating AI analysis features into the Android accounting application. The goal is to leverage AI to provide deeper insights, automate tasks, and enhance the overall user experience.

## 2. Objectives

- Integrate AI models for financial data analysis.
- Provide predictive analytics for business trends.
- Automate data entry and classification where applicable.
- Enhance reporting with AI-driven insights.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1. In-Scope Features

- **Financial Trend Prediction:** Analyze historical financial data to predict future trends (e.g., sales, expenses).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns in transactions or financial records that might indicate fraud or errors.
- **Automated Categorization:** Use AI to automatically categorize transactions or expenses based on their descriptions.
- **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):** Analyze customer feedback or reviews to gauge sentiment towards products/services.

### 3.2. Out-of-Scope Features

- Real-time AI interaction (e.g., AI chatbot for financial advice).
- Complex natural language generation for reports.

## 4. Technical Considerations

### 4.1. Potential Technologies

- **On-device ML (TensorFlow Lite, ML Kit):** For lightweight models that can run offline, such as automated categorization or simple anomaly detection.
- **Cloud-based AI Services (Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS SageMaker):** For more complex models requiring significant computational resources, such as advanced predictive analytics.
- **API Integration:** Utilizing existing AI APIs for specific tasks if available and suitable.

### 4.2. Data Handling

- **Privacy and Security:** Ensure all data processed by AI models adheres to strict privacy and security standards, especially for sensitive financial information.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Develop robust data preprocessing pipelines to clean and prepare data for AI models.
- **Model Training:** Define a strategy for training and updating AI models, considering both initial training and continuous learning.

## 5. High-Level Approach

1. **Research and Selection:** Evaluate available AI technologies and services based on the identified in-scope features and technical considerations.
2. **Data Preparation:** Develop scripts and processes for extracting, cleaning, and transforming financial data for AI model consumption.
3. **Model Development/Integration:**
    - For on-device models: Develop or fine-tune models using TensorFlow Lite or ML Kit.
    - For cloud-based models: Integrate with selected cloud AI services via APIs.
4. **API Development:** Create internal APIs or services to expose AI functionalities to the Android application.
5. **UI Integration:** Design and implement user interfaces to display AI-driven insights and allow user interaction with AI features.
6. **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test AI models for accuracy, performance, and reliability. Validate insights with domain experts.
7. **Deployment and Monitoring:** Deploy AI models and monitor their performance in a production environment, with mechanisms for retraining and updates.

## 6. Next Steps

- Conduct detailed research on specific AI services and libraries suitable for financial analysis in Android.
- Define detailed data schemas for AI input and output.
- Prioritize AI features for initial implementation based on business value and technical feasibility.
